# Shortest-Job-First
Python code which provides direct answer for your OS SJF scheduling Algorithm
So in OS system we have many scheduling algortithms for Process scheduling, One of them is Shortest_Job_First Algorithm. It can be Preemptive and Non-Preemptive as well. Genreally we use various algorithms in order to get least response time, least waiting time. Every algorithms's response to certain set of inputs might be different.

In SJF scheduling, the process with shortest time is executed first, and so on.
This code automates the calculation process for students and directly gives output for given set of inputs along with gnatt chart for better understanding!

Here is how You can use it,

1>No-Preemptive
Run the program on python editor and give input
